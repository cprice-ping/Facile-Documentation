Experience showing the PingFed AuthN API used for a token request

* [Simple](../simple) --> AuthN Widget --> Decoder

**Notes:**
* To enable an app to use the API, set the `useAuthApi` **Extended Property** to `y`
* The Policy is a mirror of **Sample Authentication Experiences**
* Default is to use the Widget app for that Policy - you can change it to the API Explorer

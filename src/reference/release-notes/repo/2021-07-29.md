#### Server Profile
* Facile repo moved to https://github.com/cprice-ping/Project-Facile
  * Note: https://github.com/cprice-ping/Sample-CIAM is deprecated
* Updates to `run.properties`
  * Moved to `pf.admin.baseUrl` for OIDC SSO
* P1 MFA IK --> 1.4.1
* Facile PAZ Policies injected

#### Fixes
* Removed the delete of `pf-pingone-connector.jar` from `50-before-post-start.sh` - this fixes the External Server --> PingOne Enterprise error

#### Known Issues (7/29/2021)
* PingOne Verify flow doesn't work
* Neither does CIBA (Postman changes for 1.4.1)
* MFA 1.4.1 - Manage Devices - busted
* PF \ PA logging not quite right -- need to look at `log4j2.xml`

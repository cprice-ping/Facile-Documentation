#### Server Profile
* PF `log4j2.xml` changes
  * Logs are now rotated - this should alleviate long-term pressure on the cluster
  
* `/pingauthorize`
  * Initial `dsconfig` set to allow PAZ to standup properly (Facile wiring is done in Postman)

#### Known Issues (7/29/2021)
* ~~PingOne Verify flow doesn't work~~
* ~~Neither does CIBA (Postman changes for 1.4.1)~~
* ~~MFA 1.4.1 - Manage Devices - busted~~
* PF \ PA logging not quite right -- need to look at `log4j2.xml`

## Things we need (Non-Tech)
* Where do people (Prospects \ Customers \ SAs) go to get help with integration?
  * Sample Code (where is this?)
    * PingOne Dev code is buried in the PingIdentity Github
    * Needs to reflect the broader development fabric
    * Proper documentation on usage and how to integrate with an app
  * Solutions Architects (Are they developers?)
  * Product (frequently non-responsive -- and who in Product is this?)
* Who in Ping is advocating for Developers?
* If not for Developers - **who** are we creating Product for?
* Documentation
  * We still are not very good at this
  * Auth0 onboards applications with in-line \ contextual quickstart
    * Think what we're attemping with `api-docs` and do that from the P1 App settings

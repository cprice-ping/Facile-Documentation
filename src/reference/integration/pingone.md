# Integration - PingOne

Identity is a critical function of any application - **but** it's not the _reason_ the application exists.

It should be seamlessly woven into the broader functionality and be consumed **quickly** so that the focus
is the **business value**  of the application.

We should be enabling *anyone* to do this as quickly as we possibly can. 

Pointing to generic libraries like AppAuth isn't good enough -- we shouldn't be putting our faith that the guidance for non-Ping integration is sufficient for
Customers to do this integration (for example - ForgeRock has an SDK that's a wrapper to AppAuth because the native
integration of that library is not trivial)
